# Data Abstraction

1. **Static Method:** Primary use -> as functions, i.e compute and return the value
2. **Instance Method:** Primary use -> as data-type operation, i.e examine or change value/state of object

1. **Assignment Operation**:
   - Primitive types -> Copy value.
   - Reference types -> Copy reference.
2. Passing arguments to method is equivalent to assignment operation
3. **Arrays** are objects
   - As with strings, java provides special language support for arrays
   - Arrays hold *references* and not *values* -> easily movable

1. **Data-type**: Set of values and operations on them
2. **Object/Instance:** It is a result/instance of a class. Classes are like blueprint of objects
