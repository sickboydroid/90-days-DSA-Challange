# DSA Log

## DAY 11 (23 MAR 2023)

1. Phew! Ramadan has started. There are still more than hours left for iftar and I have already started to feel dizzy 
2. Learning about Dynamic Programming
3. However from past few days I haven't read that many pages of Algorithms Book.
   1. I found that the concepts and questions present in the book really help in DSA
4. I am having problems with graph questions of leetcode. But I am currently focusing more on DP.
5. IDK why but from last night I am missing my ex so much. Mainly because we used talk after sehri last year.

## DAY 10 (21 MAR 2023)

1. Yep! I am back... And this time I literally gonna rock
2. Also I am attempting mostly medium problems. To be honest I don't find them as hard as I used to think
3. **Algorithms By Sedgewick** is also a great book. Especially its exercises
4. The only problem is that I am focusing more on DSA than I on acadmeic studies. ;)
