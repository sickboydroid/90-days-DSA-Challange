Me and Haseeb also went to Dialgam for some work, it was so cold.

## DAY 4 (Happy new year)

Found [this roadmap](https://github.com/sickboydroid/coding-interview-university) thanks to **Daniil**.
Now i an going to follow above resource but with this I will be continuing my formal studies as well.

The aboe link is very useful as I don't have to search through youtube to find a good coding lecture.
Thanks Daniil.

## DAY 5 (Break up ends)

It has been a week (since 3 jan 2023) since I last time learnt something.
On 3rd Jan 2023, Khadija broke up with me. It hurted so much that i wasn't able of focus.
After that yesterday, i was ill. It was because of dehydration. I was admitted for a whole day. The pain was insane.
But now I am feeling kinda Okay so from today I am back on track. I might not be able to continue this challenge after a month because my exams are in March. But still I will be updating this repo from today again.

Thanks to **Fazil**, **Mushair**, and **Daniil** whole helped me to move on. Especially Fazil, he stayed with me all day long for 4-5 days. That really helped.

The bright side of this break up is that I will have extra time to focus on my hobbies. Also like my ex said, it was just a waste of time and we had no future together (it hurts but still if you think about it, it is not wrong...).

So lets forget our past and think about future by focusing on present.

Holy shit!! I just made it up...
Byee!!
