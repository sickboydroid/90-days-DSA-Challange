Me and Haseeb also went to Dialgam for some work, it was so cold.

## DAY 4 (Happy new year)

Found [this roadmap](https://github.com/sickboydroid/coding-interview-university) thanks to **Daniil**.
Now i an going to follow above resource but with this I will be continuing my formal studies as well.

The above link is very useful as I don't have to search through youtube to find a good coding lecture.
Thanks Daniil.

## DAY 5 (Break up ends)

It has been a week (since 3 jan 2023) since I last time learnt something.
On 3rd Jan 2023, Khadija broke up with me. It hurted so much that i wasn't able of focus.
After that yesterday, i was ill. It was because of dehydration. I was admitted for a whole day. The pain was insane.
But now I am feeling kinda Okay so from today I am back on track. I might not be able to continue this challenge after a month because my exams are in March. But still I will be updating this repo from today again.

Thanks to **Fazil**, **Mushair**, and **Daniil** whole helped me to move on. Especially Fazil, he stayed with me all day long for 4-5 days. That really helped.

The bright side of this break up is that I will have extra time to focus on my hobbies. Also like my ex said, it was just a waste of time and we had no future together (it hurts but still if you think about it, it is not wrong...).

**So lets forget our past and think about future by focusing on present.**

Holy shit!! I just made it up...
Byee!!

## DAY 6 (11 JAN 2023)

So today was another great day only because of [this](https://youtu.be/TXeHkfYyTPg) video ðŸ¤£.
I gotta say that this video helped me to realise that she isn't special. Everyone thinks that their
gf/ex was special and that nobody can understand their feelings. But the truth is that every girl
is human and humans by nature have human behaivour. So no one speical except yourself.

Coming back to coding, i will be noting the date of day as well from now on.

## DAY 7 (13 JAN 2023)

Again feeling sick (real sick) but I can handle it.
So today I messaged her and apologised for the last time. I sent her a goodbye message and prayed for their good.
She hasn't replied but who cares!!

Coming back to coding again. Today I completed implementing LinkedList and also completed DoublyLinkedList.
I also implemented stack. Now I am going to practice a bit on leetcode.
From tomorrow I think I will only make digital notes of LinkedList and stack and practice some leetcode problems on them.
It has snowed today. Daniil is not replying, I hope he is ok.
I am going to get a marker tomorrow, white board days are back guys!!
Also I am gonna rename this repo.
I will name it may be **My DSA Journey (start date - end date)**.
This repo will be the biggest thing I have created.

Let's rock.
