## MAJOR BREAK (DAY 18 (05 Aug 2023))

1. Okay i need to face it, Programming is eating up too much time. I have decided (4 days ago) that I will focus only on studies for now.
2. I am in 12th right now and it is already august. My first attempt of JEE Mains is in January (only about 5 months left) and after that I have my 12th boards in April and even before these two I have Pre-Boards in September/October. That is why I am deciding to take a complete break from coding altogether
3. I won't be making any commits to this repo (or any other repo for that matter), I won't be accepting any pull requests (which i have never received anyways) and I won't be making any pull requests
4. It also means that I won't be doing any leetcode or moving further in python
5. WHEN WILL BE I BACK?
   - It depends, If my January attempt of JEE Mains got well and I didn't focus of Advance then may be (10% chance) I will be back by May (after boards). If it didn't go well then I will only be back after July when collage starts
6. I am very excited for the upcoming journey and I am sure that I will miss coding a lot. But as the famous quote goes, "Kuch pane k liyay kuch khone bi padhta h".
7. Right now I am thinking that I would have forgot most of the things that I learnt in programming (mostly syntax and apis). But I believe that core concepts of programming will stay with me and will help me during my collage days.
8. I am also afraid of losing my typing speed. It took me only about 7 minutes to write all these things
9. I hope when I restart my coding journey in collage, I will be happy about this decision
10. So i think it is time to say goodbye
11. Signing OFF, SICKBOY (PEACE)

## DAY 17 (30 JULY 2023)

1. Holy shit! Why am i so afraid of books? I want to study but i am so afraid. I have to fix it
2. I have learned python language (for the 3rd time i guess). But this time i really switched from java
3. I kinda enjoy it but at the same time i miss java's `for` loop, its strictness and verboseness
4. But development time has significantly reduced with python, i have to say that
5. Now i am coming back to leetcode and this time with python

## DAY 16 (28 JUNE 2023)

1. I tried a contest (virtual one) on codeforce yesterday. I was able to come up with solutions of first two but they were too slow
2. I thought may be i should do contests to stay motivated but it was too difficult for me
3. Now i will complete graph data structure first and then will try to keep a streak of 30 days on leetcode
4. Tomorrow is Eid btw!!

## DAY 15 (22 JUNE 2023)

1. Learning git form the past week or so
2. Learned about branching, rebasing, merging, cherry-picking and other stuff
3. It might take 2 to 4 days before i complete it

## DAY 14 (15 JUNE 2023)

1. From past 2 days I have been learning about graphs (finally!!)
2. Learned about binary tree (almost complete)
3. Learned about Graph (40% done)
4. Solved some nice problems on binary trees

## DAY 13 (29 MAR 2023)

1. Yesterday was my chemistry paper. It didn't go that well but it was ok.
2. I might not be able to solve lots of questions in the upcoming days as english paper is coming but I will still try my best

## DAY 12 (25 MAR 2023)

1. The DSA journey is going great but my academic studies are suffering
2. I have a lot of self-doubt
3. But now I am again (for the millionth time) going to start manage my time
4. I have created few rules to follow, let's see how it goes
5. I am still thankful to **Danill** who introduced me with DSA. Even though he sent a message about a month ago mentioning that he doesn't want to talk with me. But anyways, he is my model. Thanks to him once again. I won't forget his help and the interview on Pramp
6. BTW I am working on my typing speed as well. I am now currently typing on my laptop instead of keyboard. I think typing on laptop is much easier than on keyboard.
7. It is raining outside

## DAY 11 (23 MAR 2023)

1. Phew! Ramadan has started. There are still more than hours left for iftar and I have already started to feel dizzy
2. Learning about Dynamic Programming
3. However from past few days I haven't read that many pages of Algorithms Book.
   1. I found that the concepts and questions present in the book really help in DSA
4. I am having problems with graph questions of leetcode. But I am currently focusing more on DP.
5. IDK why but from last night I am missing my ex so much. Mainly because we used talk after sehri last year.

## DAY 10 (21 MAR 2023)

1. Yep! I am back... And this time I literally gonna rock
2. Also I am attempting mostly medium problems. To be honest I don't find them as hard as I used to think
3. **Algorithms By Sedgewick** is also a great book. Especially its exercises
4. The only problem is that I am focusing more on DSA than I on acadmeic studies. ;)
