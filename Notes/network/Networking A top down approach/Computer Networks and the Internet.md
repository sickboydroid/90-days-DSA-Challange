# C1: Computer Networks and the Internet

- **Internet**: Computer network that interconnects billions of computing devices
- **Hosts/End Systems**: Devices that are connected to internet
    1. **Clients**: Receiver hosts
    2. **Servers**: Sender hosts (tend to be more powerful machines)
- End systems are connected together by:
    1. Communication Links (like highways) and
    2. Packet Switches (like intersectoins). Prominant types:
        - Routers
        - Link-Layer Switches
- **Route** is the path of packet

- End systems access internet through ISPs (Internet Service Providers).
- **Internet socket interface** is a set of rules that a sending program must follow so that the internet can deliver the data to the destination program.
- **Protocol**: Set of rules defining the format and order of messages for communicating with other entities. These rules also define the actions to be taken when sending or receiving messages.

> - **Data Center**: Collection of interconnected hosts (servers in this case).
> - Hosts are called **Blades** in Data Centers and are stacked in racks (20 to 40 in each rack)

**Access Network**: Network that physically connects an end system to first router (called edge router)
